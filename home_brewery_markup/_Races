# Arcanacore Races
There are many playable races that each provide a unique spin to characters.

They all have various physical stats and proclivities to which their people generally exhibit or adhere. They all provide some measure of stat boost, common proficiancies and racial features. These features and boosts are granted simply by being a member of the selected race and are usable as presented, regardless of any other character options chosen by the player.

Many races have subraces options which allow to further make your character your own.
