Fighters have no particular special qualities other than their raw capacity in martial weapons ability. In this they excel far above the rest.

### Second Wind
*1st level Fighter Feature*

if you are within 20 initiative of your next turn, you can use an interupt action to recover an amount of HP = 1d12 + your fighter level for an initiative impact of 5. Once you use this ability you cannot use it again until you complete a short or long rest.

### Action Surge
*2nd level Fighter Feature*

statring at 2nd level, you have a pool of action surge points = 20 + your fighter level. On your turn when you take an action, rather than increasing your initiative impact by the cost of that action, you simply remove an equal number of action surge points. No more that 20 action surge points can be used on your turn.

Once your action surge points are expended, they do not return until you complete a short or long rest

### Martial Archetype

## Fighter Fighting Styles

##### Archery
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

##### Blind Fighting
You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.

##### Defense
While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

##### Dueling
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

##### Great Weapon Fighting
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.



##### Interception
When a creature you can see hits a target, other than you, within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a shield or a simple or martial weapon to use this reaction.

##### Protection
When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.

##### Superior Technique
You learn one maneuver of your choice from among those available to the Battle Master archetype. If a maneuver you use requires your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects, the saving throw DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).

You gain one superiority die, which is a d6 (this die is added to any superiority dice you have from another source). This die is used to fuel your maneuvers. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.

##### Thrown Weapon Fighting
You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon.

In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.

##### Two-Weapon Fighting
When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

##### Unarmed Fighting
Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier on a hit. If you aren't wielding any weapons or a shield when you make the attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8.
