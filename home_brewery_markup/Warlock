# Warlock
Warlocks are a bit of a mystery as far as magic users are concerned. The Magic they use is channeled from some other far greater and far more powerful being they refer to as their Patron 
{width:185px}

A single Patron is likely to have many followers and they are not allways inclined to be benevolent beings. In truth, they tend to reflect all forms of alignment. Because of this, many warlocks tend to be very reclusive, and avoid the ever prying eyes of society.
