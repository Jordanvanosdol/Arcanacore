# Arcanacore *V0.03*
Welcome traveler from an antique land. Please sit and tell us of what you have seen. The unheard of monsters, who slither and bite. Tell us of the wondrous items and and artifacts you have found, their mysteries yet to be unlocked. Of the vexing vocations and surprising skills you have seen.

### Arcanacore combat System.
The Arcanacore combat system is completely based on an upward initiative system. Any given character or creature takes its turn on an initiative count starting at 0 in the begininning of the encoutner, and continues to increase until the encounter is complete. Any creatures that have their turn on an initiative count must resolve their turn before moving on and determining their next turn. 
If two creatures have the same initiative for a turn, they roll to determin who goes first. If no creature has a turn on the next initiative count, the encounter just continues to count up until there is a turn that needs taking.

For realtime tracking purposes, one second takes approximately 5 counts of initiative. For perspective, once the encoutner reaches an initiative of 300, about one minute of real time have passed.

### Action Window
On each creature's turn, it has an Action Window. On it's turn, it can perform any number of actions into this action window as long as the total sum of Actions Cost is less then 30.

All creatures have a base action point cost. Most humanoids have a base cost of 10 when they start their turn, leaving 20 points for actions on their turn.

### Taking your turn
On your turn you concentrate on 3 main points. 

* **Movement:** Simply as part of taking your turn, you may move up to your max speed for any one movement speed you have for no action cost.
* **Actions:** Any action available to you such as casting a spell, making a melee attack, or interaction with an object. You may perform multiple actions, but the total action cost of your choices may not exceed your action window.
* **Recovery:** You determine when your next turn occurs. This is done by adding the total sum of the current turn's action points + the encoutner's current initiative.


### Initiative Impacting Choices.
Nearly anything a character can do will cost initiative, or postpone their next until a specific initiative.

#### Starting your turn
When a creature's turn is reached in initiative, that creature automaticly adds their base creature action cost to their action window. 

For example, most humanoids have an innitiatve impact of 10, however a halfling which, would be able to moved more quickly, may be only 8. Thus allowing the halfling to, over time act more frequently.

#### Action Point Cost
Different actions demand defferent amounts of action cost. Taking the attack action, for example, has an action cost of 20 action points, whereas a smaller action such as an object interaction of pushing a button, may only have an action cost of 4.

#### Spell Recovery time
Some spells have a recovery time. This recovery time is added to your Recovery calculation for your next turn, but does not need to placed in your action window.

This reflect spells that have a rather quick casting time, but impart a taxing effect from casting from the spell.

#### Spell casting time
Spell casting time refers to the delay between starting the casting spell and how long before the spell effect activates. The casting time should always be declared in the spell description. From the moment a spell casting begins until the spell effect maniftests, your turn is effectivly on pause, and resumes when the spell manifests.

#### Action Interupt
Action Interupts are actions that you can take out of your turn. Most define a trigger condition and require somthing called an initiative impact. if an action interupt has an action interupt of 10 and your next turn is on an intitiative count of 90, this action will push your next turn to an initiative count of 100.
