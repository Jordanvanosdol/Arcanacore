###### proficiencies.
:: **Weapons:** simple weapons, shortswords

### Expertise
At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves' tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.

At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves' tools) to gain this benefit.

### Precision
Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.

You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table.

### Between the Lines
During your training you learned comunicate messages an ideas in conversation, that have nothing to do with surface value of the conversation. Only another creature that can 'Read Between the Lines' can understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.

In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves' guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.

### Off the Cuff(maybe to much?)
Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly.

When you deal extra damage with your `Precision` feature, you can take either the Disengage, Help, Hide, or Dash action for free without impacting your initiative window.

Additionally, When you take the Disengage, Help, Hide, or Dash action, you can take the Disengage, Help, or Hide action on your turn without impacting your action window.

### Profession
At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your abilities from the list of available archetypes. Your archetype choice grants you features at **3rd** level and then again at **5th**, **9th**, **13th**, and **15th** level.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach **4th** level, and again at **8th**, **10th**, **12th**, **16th**, and **19th** levl, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.

### Uncanny Dodge
Starting at 6th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use an action interupt (initiative impact: 4) to halve the attack's damage against you.

### Evasion
At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon's lightning breath or a fireball spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

### Reliable Talent
By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.
### Blindsense
Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.

### Slippery Mind
By 17th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.

### Elusive
Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren't incapacitated.

### Stroke of Luck
At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
