# Knight
Knights are the champions of virtue and heroism. Their strength stems from the willingness to risk harm to themselves for a greater purpose or for the aid of others. Knights are often found aligning themselves to the principles or values upheald by dieties. 

Knights dont necisarily need to be good warriors. Although rare, a knight can align to a darker pursuite. For these knights moral princple is not an obsticle for them, so long as they have a pursuite, principle, value, or goal they are willing to risk their own life for.
