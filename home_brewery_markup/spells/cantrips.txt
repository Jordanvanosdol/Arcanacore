# Spells *V 0.01*
Spells in arcanacore are a bit more complicated that the normal RPG. Every spell as a base casting time indicated on in the spell description. Additionally some spell may also indicate a recovery cost. The recovery cost is tacked onto your initiative impact, but does not need to fit inside your action window. 

All characters have an action window of 20 action points. If you choose a spell with an action cost of 14, and a recovery cost of 10, you still have up to 6 action points you can use in your action window. Regardless if another action is chosen you must tack on the additional 10 pioints to your next turn calculation. 

For a typical character taking their turn on an initiative count of 30, the calculation to determine when you take your next turn for simply casting the above spell would be as follows. 

**30** (current initiative) +**10** (for a base character, simpy starting their turn) +**14** (for all points used in your action window) +**10** (recovery time) = 30+10+14+10=**64**. Therefor, the caster's next turn would take place on the initiative count of 64 when they begin casting on an initiative count of 30.

#### Cantrip Leveling

**Cantrip Tiers:**

Cantrips are spells that are second nature for a person to cast. They do not level like normal spells who's strength you can choose by using a higher or lower spell slot. Many cantrips do however increase in strength as the caster's strength goes. This is determined by cantrip tier. 

There are **4 cantrip tiers**. Character level(1-20) which are reached at levels **1st**, **5th**, **11th**, and **16th** level respectively

A flickering flame appears in your hand. The flame remains there for the duration and harms neither you nor your equipment. The flame sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The spell ends if you dismiss it as an action or if you cast it again.

You can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends the spell. When you cast this spell, or as an action on a later turn, you can hurl the flame at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 fire damage.
