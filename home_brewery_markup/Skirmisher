# Skirmisher
Skirmishers are mobile combatants with a vast amount of knowledge of how best to utilize terrain to their advantage. Their vast understanding of the lay of the land gives them unique bonuses in combat that they can use to swing the tides of battle in their favor. Even when in terrain they find otherwise foreign, they still feel in their element.

Regardless of their acuity of the land, they're swift fighters, able to strike with multiple different weapons easily, even in the thick of battle.

### Eye for Trouble
*1st level Skirmisher feature*

A trained habit for the common Skirmisher, enemies' abilities are a book to be read and covered in red edit marks. You gain the "Observe" action, which can be used to study your opponents and learn information about them.

##### Observe:
*Initiative Impact of 10*

You study your target's movements and quickly glean their fighting capabilities and weaknesses. If the target is a creature and its Challenge Rating is below or equal to your Skirmisher level, you learn their current hit points, armor class, and one of their saving throw modifiers of your choice. If the target's Challenge rating is higher than your Skirmisher level, you must first succeed on a Wisdom (Insight) roll. The DC of this roll is equal to 10 + (the target's CR minus your Skirmisher level) * 2.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.

\page

### Fighting Style:

At 1st level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options.

You cannot take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can replace a Fighting Style you know with another Fighting Style available to Skirmishers. This replacement represents a shift of focus in your martial practice.

##### Archery:
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

##### Blind Fighting
You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.

##### Defense
While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

##### Dueling
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

##### Druidic Warrior
You learn two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. They count as Skirmisher spells for you, and Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of these cantrips with another cantrip from the druid spell list.

##### Great Weapon Fighting
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

##### Opportunisitic Striker
When you hit a creature that is unaware of your presence, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll. You can also re-roll one damage die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.

##### Thrown Weapon Fighting
You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon.

In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.

##### Two-Weapon Fighting
When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

##### Watchful Combatant
You have a +2 to your Armor Class, Attack, and Damage rolls against a creature that you've successfully Observed.

### Terrain Tactician
*2nd level Skirmisher feature*

If a locale is very similar but not explicitly described as something from the table, you gain those respective bonuses.

You gain additional Provincial Prowess bonuses at 6th and 11th level.

{{classTable,frame

}}

### Spellcasting
*2nd level Skirmisher feature*

###### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the Skirmisher spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Skirmisher table shows when you learn more Skirmisher spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the Skirmisher spells you know and replace it with another spell from the Skirmisher spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

<div style='margin-top:20px'></div>

{{note
###### Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Skirmisher spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Skirmisher spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

When casting spells, subtract 5 from the start-up and cool-down initiative impacts of cast spells. You cannot reduce either initiative impacts to a number below 0.
}}


\page

### Expertise
*3rd level Skirmisher feature*

At 3rd level, choose two of your Skill Proficiencies. Your Proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses that Chosen skill.

You can also speak, read, and write two additional languages of your choice.

### Skirmisher Archetype

##### Options:
<u>TBD</u>

### Quick Switch

Starting at 3rd Level, your squat reflexes while in the midst of combat become swift enough to let you swap weaponry at a moment's notice. You can draw and stow any number of weapons at any time during your turn without any Initiative Impact. 

If you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with a melee weapon attack and hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack in the same turn, apply your damage modifier to the ranged weapon attack twice. 

If you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with a ranged weapon attack and hit a creature with a melee weapon attack in the same turn, apply your damage modifier to the melee weapon attack twice.


### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th levels, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.

### Extra Attack
*5th level Skirmisher feature*

**At 5th level**, When you take the attack action, you may attack twice instead of once. additionally your initiative impact for taking the attack action is reduced from 20 to 18.

**At 15th level**, you can make 3 attacks on your turn at the cost of only 16 initiative impact when you take the attack action


\column

### Eye for Trouble Improvement
*6th level Skirmisher feature*

When you use the Observe action against a creature with a Challenge Rating higher than your Skirmisher Level, treat your Skirmisher level as 2 levels higher. You automatically succeed on the Wisdom (Insight) check if your level exceeds the Challenge Rating of the target.

### Terrain Tactician Improvement
*6th level Skirmisher feature*

Starting at 6th level, on top of any bonuses gained at 2nd level, additional combat benefits are gained based on the terrain you're standing in, as detailed below.

|  Coast/ Ocean / Sea  | Your vision is not limited while attacking underwater and none of your weapon attacks suffer negative effects as a result of attacking underwater. 
|  Arctic/ Glacial/ Icy  | When you take the Hide action when using snow or ice as cover, you have a +5 to your Stealth roll.

<div style='margin-top:40px'></div>

### Steady Breath
*8th level Skirmisher feature*

Starting at 8th level, if you are within 20 initiative of your next turn, you can use an Interrupt action to give yourself a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1 temporary hit point) for an initiative impact of 5. You can do this a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
