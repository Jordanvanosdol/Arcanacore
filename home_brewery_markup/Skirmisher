# Skirmisher
Skirmishers are mobile combatants with a vast amount of knowledge of how best to utilize terrain to their advantage. Their vast understanding of the lay of the land gives them unique bonuses in combat that they can use to swing the tides of battle in their favor. Even when in terrain they find otherwise foreign, they still feel in their element.

Regardless of their acuity of the land, they're swift fighters, able to strike with multiple different weapons easily, even in the thick of battle.

You study your target's movements and quickly glean their fighting capabilities and weaknesses. If the target is a creature and its Challenge Rating is below or equal to your Skirmisher level, you learn their armor class, damage vulnerabilities, and one of their saving throw modifiers of your choice. If the target's Challenge rating is higher than your Skirmisher level, you must first succeed on an Insight roll. The DC of this roll is equal to 10 + (the target's CR minus your Skirmisher level) * 2.

You cannot take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can replace a Fighting Style you know with another Fighting Style available to Skirmishers. This replacement represents a shift of focus in your martial practice.

You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

##### Blind Fighting
You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.

When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

### Spellcasting
*2nd level Skirmisher feature*

By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See Spells Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the Skirmisher spell list.

###### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the Skirmisher spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Skirmisher table shows when you learn more Skirmisher spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the Skirmisher spells you know and replace it with another spell from the Skirmisher spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

{{note
###### Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Skirmisher spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Skirmisher spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
